Thorlabs motor controller
=======================

Note: this is a wrapper class around an external controller to fit it into hyperion structure

Is based on the imported Thorlabs APT python software from https://github.com/qpit/thorlabs_apt/tree/master/thorlabs_apt.
This is installed in hyperion and can be found in C:/Users/NAME/AppData/Local/Continuum/anaconda3/envs/hyperion/Lib/site-packages/thorlabs_apt.
This controller basically is just a wrapper to make things work within hyperion.
The core is not always well documented, for better descriptions see the thorlabs_motor_instrument.
