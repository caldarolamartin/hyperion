The Hyperion package is designed to help you to build your application
to control a complex experimental setup. It should be seen as a scaffold to
build the instrumentation software you need for the unique application or
experiment you are working on.

Hyperion is under continuous development and started at the
`Kuipers Lab <https://kuiperslab.tudelft.nl/>`_ at
Technical University Delft. We made special efforts to solve the
specific problems we encounter at the lab when developing software that
automatizes repetitive tasks and allows researches to perform reproducible
experiments.
